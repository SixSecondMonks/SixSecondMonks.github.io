<p>Born and raised on a strict diet of corn in the Midwest, Tim then spent time on the East Coast trying out stuff like college and work before heeding the call to head out West.</p>
<p>He currently resides in San Francisco with his better half spending time hacking on stuff both software and hardware.</p>
<p>His interests lie in building cool stuff, the more sparkly bits the better.</p>
