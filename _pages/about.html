<div><img class="align-right" width="300" src="/assets/images/timkettering/tim-self.jpg"></div>
<p>Born and raised on a strict diet of corn in the Midwest, Tim then spent time on the East Coast trying out stuff like college and work before heeding the call to head out West.</p>
<p>He currently resides in San Francisco with his better half spending time hacking on stuff both software and hardware.</p>
<p>His interests lie in building cool stuff, the more sparkly bits the better.</p>

<p>James lives in Berkeley and spends his spare time hacking on various open source software/hardware projects.</p>
<p>He likes to read Roman socio-political history and contemporary philosophy. For some absurd reason, his cat will sleep on his lap when he reads books on these topics, and only these topics.</p>
