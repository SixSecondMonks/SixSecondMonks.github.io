## We made it! Sanctuary of Self at Burning Man 2015

We had an excellent time at Burning Man 2015, and we especially enjoyed showing off Sanctuary of Self to all our fellow Burners. We were at Diva Camp, 7:30 and D, right next to the appropriately named BAAAHS (big-ass amazingly awesome homosexual sheep) art car. Combined with their music and our visuals, Sanctuary of Self was a hotspot!

Here's what it looked like from above at night. Our LED wall is in the carport to the left.

We noticed that people loved to dance along with the adjacent BAAHS art car!

The Sanctuary of Self was a blast, and we hope to bring it next year — upgraded and improved! Just what will these improvements be, you ask? Stay tuned... or tell us what you would like to see!
