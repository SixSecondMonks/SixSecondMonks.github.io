### Events

#### Vietnamese Coffee and ASL 
On Tuesday and Thursday morning during the week of the burn, the camp came together to provide delicious freshly-brewed vietnamese coffee to anyone who passed by.  In addition, due to our camp being largely ASL-signers, we offered improtu lessons to anyone who stopped in and wanted to learn a few signs while enjoying their coffee.

#### Friday Night Bash
Early evening Friday, the camp threw a bash with live music, lights and lots of burner love for anyone who happened to pedal along on Cosmio.

### Art
We brought several interactive light and sound pieces.  (LED Wall), (Hexagasm), (Backfire Sign).
